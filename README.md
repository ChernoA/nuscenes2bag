# nuScenes2Bag

Simple C++ tool for converting the [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/) dataset from [Aptiv](https://www.aptiv.com).

The tool loads the json metadata and then the sample files for each scene. The sample are converted in a suitable ROS msg and written to a bag. TF tree is also written.

Probably the original dataset is also collected by Aptiv using ROS, so most data has the same format.

## Install

The `master` branch should compile on Ubuntu 19.04. It requires C++17 and Boost 1.66.  
The `ubuntu_1604` branch uses C++11 and has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.  
The `ubuntu_1804` branch has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.  

The tool is a normal ROS package. Place it under a workspace and build it with catkin.


## Usage

Convert one scene to a bag file, saved in a new directory.
Scene '0001' will be saved to 'nuscenes_bags/1.bag'
```
rosrun nuscenes2bag nuscenes2bag --scene_number 0001 --sample_dir /path/to/dataset/ --out nuscenes_bags/
```


Convert the entire dataset to bag files.
This processes 4 scenes simultaneously, however the scene numbers are not processed in numerical order.
```
rosrun nuscenes2bag nuscenes2bag --sample_dir /path/to/dataset/ --out nuscenes_bags/ --jobs 4
```
